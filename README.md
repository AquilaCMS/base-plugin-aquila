### Linter info ###

A linter is now available. Run the following command in your terminal to enable it : 'npm run lint -c .eslintrc'.
Issues will appear in 'output' and will be underlined in red in your code.
You may need to restart VSCode for the linter to take effect. 
If you are modifying the plugin while it's in AquilaCMS, you may remove the 'node_modules', 'package', and 'package-lock' file and use 'npm run lint:check'.
